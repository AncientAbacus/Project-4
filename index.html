      <p>
        Every year, <span id="emphasis">millions of individuals worldwide undergo surgical procedures</span>, 
        each of which plays a significant role in shaping their health outcomes. The types of surgeries 
        performed vary considerably across different demographics, with distinct trends emerging based 
        on age and underlying health conditions. Through our interactive visualizations, we aim to examine 
        how surgical trends shift over time, the variation in biomarkers across different operations, 
        and the impact of these procedures on mortality. 
      </p>

      <div class="header">
        <h2>[PROTOTYPE]: Our progress so far...</h2>
        <span id="emphasis">1. What have you done so far?</span>
        <p>So far, we have developed two interactive visualizations. The first is a streamgraph that shows the 
          frequency of different surgery types based on age. You are able to hover over the differently colored 
          sections to see which type they correspond to. Next is an analysis on surgical positions and how long
          surgery takes in each. Duration is split between operation, case, and anethesia duration, which is then
          subdivided by surgery position. This allows for more fine grained comparative analysis.</p>
        <span id="emphasis">2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why?</span>
        <p>One of the most challenging aspects of our project will be integrating the different visualizations 
          into a cohesive narrative that effectively communicates the impact of surgery on health outcomes. 
          Additionally, we anticipate that creating a user-friendly interface that allows for easy exploration 
          of the data will be a significant challenge. We will take peer reviews into considersation and ensure
          that our visualization is both easy and interesting to read. Part of these next steps will include incorporating
          chemical results and correlating them with diagnoses and surgery types. </p>

      <h4>Operation Types</h4>
      <div id="stream"></div>

      <p>In this visualization, we observe how the types of surgical procedures vary significantly 
        across different age groups. The data reveals that while younger patients often undergo procedures 
        related to orthopedic and trauma care, older individuals represent a larger proportion of surgeries. 
        Particularly notable are the higher frequencies of procedures such as biliary/pancreatic, colorectal, 
        breast, and stomach surgeries, which are more common among the elderly.

          <h4>Surgical Positions Analysis</h4>
          <p class="viz-description">
              This visualization combines operation duration analysis with surgical position illustrations. 
              The top plot shows the distribution of three types of durations for the selected position, 
              helping understanding of typical procedure lengths. The bottom diagram illustrates 
              the corresponding patient positioning technique. Select different positions from the 
              dropdown menu to explore various surgical approaches and their associated timing patterns.
