      <p>
        Every year, <span id="emphasis">millions of individuals worldwide undergo surgical procedures</span>, 
        each of which plays a significant role in shaping their health outcomes. The types of surgeries 
        performed vary considerably across different demographics, with distinct trends emerging based 
        on age and underlying health conditions. Through our interactive visualizations, we aim to examine 
        how surgical trends shift over time, the variation in biomarkers across different operations, 
        and the impact of these procedures on mortality. 
      </p>

      <h4>How does age influence the types of operations carried out?</h4>
      <div id="stream"></div>

      <p>Here, it's clear to see that different operations (and operations in general) are more common at different ages. While younger patients mostly undergo minor resections, vascular operations, and transplantations,  
        older individuals see a higher frequencies of procedures such as biliary/pancreatic, colorectal, 
        breast, and stomach (while also making up the vast majority of surgeries in our dataset).

        <h4>How do surgical positions change how we experience surgery?</h4>
        <p class="viz-description">
          This visualization combines operation duration analysis with surgical position illustrations. 
          The top plot shows the distribution of three types of durations for the selected position, 
          helping understanding of typical procedure lengths. The bottom diagram illustrates 
          the corresponding patient positioning technique. <span id='emphasis'>Select different positions from the
